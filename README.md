# 🧠 Analysis of Various Factors Affecting Depression using Machine Learning 📊  

> “Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.” – Albus Dumbledore ✨  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Ever wondered what factors contribute to depression? Is it your late-night doom-scrolling? ☠️ Your coffee addiction? ☕ Or maybe the never-ending emails? 📩  

This project leverages **Machine Learning** to analyze various factors influencing depression. Using real-world data, we explore the patterns, correlations, and predictive power of different attributes to understand the **silent epidemic** better.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools  
- **Python** 🐍 (because why not?)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📒 (for all those glorious visualizations)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** 🔢 (data manipulation magic)  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** 🎨 (because a picture is worth a thousand data points)  
- **Scikit-Learn** 🤖 (building ML models like a pro)  

## 🔍 What’s Inside?  
✔️ Data Cleaning (because messy data = messy mind 😵)  
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊  
✔️ Feature Engineering 🔧  
✔️ Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) 🤖  
✔️ Model Evaluation (because bad models are like bad therapists—useless!)  

## 🚀 How to Run It?  
1. Clone the repo 🏴‍☠️  
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/marie4maria/Under-the-Surface-Insights-into-Depression
2. Install the dependencies 📦
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Fire up Jupyter Notebook 🚀
jupyter notebook

4. Run the Notebook and watch the magic happen ✨  

## 🤯 Cool Insights (Spoiler Alert!)  
🔹 Certain lifestyle choices have a strong correlation with depression.  
🔹 Machine learning can predict depression risk with impressive accuracy! 🎯  
🔹 Data science might just be the therapy we all need. 😆  

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model  
We use **Logistic Regression** as our baseline model to predict whether an individual is at risk of depression based on various factors.
